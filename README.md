# Thesis
This is my thesis project. 
The project is for the thesis. Please refer the paper "Identify copyist of Avila Bible with Decision Tree" for detail. 

In a word, we start from a little point that is multi-classification problem of graph, 
and then introduce a pattern recognition system for the related problems. 

Specifically, in this work, I uses the data extracted from 800 images of the “Avila Bible”, 
a giant Latin copy of the whole Bible produced during the XII century between Italy and Spain. 
The Decision Tree model is used to conduct the analysis and prediction. 
The related graphs and tables are showed to visualize the data, experiment results, and model capacity. 
The main goal of the model is to predict who is the copyist of the given a part of content.
